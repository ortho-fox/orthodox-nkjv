# Orthodox NKJV

_The remaining books from the Orthodox canon are being added in future updates to provide the complete collection of Eastern Orthodox Christian books of the bible.._

**Orthodox NKJV** is a Node.js module that contains the complete text of the New King James Version (NKJV) Bible, organized in separate JSON files for each book. This project aims to make the NKJV Bible data easily accessible to developers for use in TypeScript/JavaScript applications.

## Convert Markdown to JSON

From the root directory of the project, run:

`node scripts/convert_markdown_to_json.js Tobit`

In this case the script will find a file in the markdown directory and create a file called tobit.md in the markdown directory.

The markdown file must be formatted without error or the script will choke. See /books/markdown/tobit.md for an example of clean and correct formatting.

## Convert JSON to XML

To convert a specific book (e.g., tobit) to XML:

`node scripts/convert_json_to_xml.js tobit`

To convert all JSON files to XML:

`node scripts/convert_json_to_xml.js` or `node scripts/convert_json_to_xml.js *`

## Folder Structure

The project is structured as follows:

```orthodox-nkjv/
|- books/
|  |- json/
|  |  |- 1-chronicles.json
|  |  |- 1-corinthians.json
|  |  |- ... (other JSON files for each book)
|  |
|  |- markdown/
|  |  |- 1-chronicles.md
|  |  |- 1-corinthians.md
|  |  |- ... (other Markdown files for each book)
|  |
|  |- xml/
|     |- 1-chronicles.xml
|     |- 1-corinthians.xml
|     |- ... (other XML files for each book)
|
|- examples/
|  |- bibleReader.ts
|  |- other-examples.ts
|
|- scripts/
|  |- convert_markdown_to_json.js
|
|- README.md
|- package.json
|- package-lock.json

```

- The `books` folder contains individual JSON files, each representing a book from the New King James Version of the Bible. These files hold the structured text data, organized into chapters and verses.

- The `examples` folder includes TypeScript example files that demonstrate how to access and use the NKJV Bible data from this module.

## Installation

This module can be installed via npm. Simply include it as a dependency in your Node.js project's `package.json` file:

```json
"dependencies": {
  "orthodox-nkjv": "0.1.0"
}
```

## Usage

To access the NKJV Bible data in your TypeScript/JavaScript project, follow these steps:

Install the Module:
Install the orthodox-nkjv module using npm as described above.

Import and Use in Your Code:
Use the readBibleBook function from the orthodox-nkjv module to read data from a specific book.

```import { promises as fsPromises } from 'fs';
import * as path from 'path';

async function readBibleBook(bookName: string): Promise<any> {
  try {
    const filePath = path.join(__dirname, 'books', `${bookName.toLowerCase()}.json`);
    const jsonData = await fsPromises.readFile(filePath, 'utf-8');
    return JSON.parse(jsonData);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(`Error reading ${bookName}: ${error.message}`);
    return null;
  }
}

async function main() {
  const genesisData = await readBibleBook('Genesis');
  if (genesisData) {
    console.log(genesisData); // Bible data for the book of Genesis
  }
}

main();
```
