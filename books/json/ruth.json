No, my daughters; for it grieves me very much for your sakes that the hand of the LORD has gone out against me!\"","num":13},{"text":"Then they lifted up their voices and wept again; and Orpah kissed her mother-in-law, but Ruth clung to her.","num":14},{"text":"And she said, \"Look, your sister-in-law has gone back to her people and to her gods; return after your sister-in-law.\"","num":15},{"text":"But Ruth said: \"Entreat me not to leave you, Or to turn back from following after you; For wherever you go, I will go; And wherever you lodge, I will lodge; Your people shall be my people, And your God, my God.","num":16},{"text":"Where you die, I will die, And there will I be buried.

So she came and has continued from morning until now, though she rested a little in the house.\"","num":7},{"text":"Then Boaz said to Ruth, \"You will listen, my daughter, will you not? Do not go to glean in another field, nor go from here, but stay close by my young women.","num":8},{"text":"Let your eyes be on the field which they reap, and go after them.

So she brought out and gave to her what she had kept back after she had been satisfied.","num":18},{"text":"And her mother-in-law said to her, \"Where have you gleaned today? And where did you work? Blessed be the one who took notice of you.\" So she told her mother-in-law with whom she had worked, and said, \"The man's name with whom I worked today is Boaz.\"","num":19},{"text":"Then Naomi said to her daughter-in-law, \"Blessed be he of the LORD, who has not forsaken His kindness to the living and the dead!\" And Naomi said to her, \"This man is a relation of ours, one of our close relatives.\"","num":20},{"text":"Ruth the Moabitess said, \"He also said to me, \"You shall stay close by my young men until they have finished all my harvest.\"'","num":21},{"text":"And Naomi said to Ruth her daughter-in-law, \"It is good, my daughter, that you go out with his young women, and that people do not meet you in any other field.\"","num":22},{"text":"So she stayed close by the young women of Boaz, to glean until the end of barley harvest and wheat harvest; and she dwelt with her mother-in-law.","num":23}],"num":2},{"verses":[{"text":"Then Naomi her mother-in-law said to her, \"My daughter, shall I not seek security for you, that it may be well with you?","num":1},{"text":"Now Boaz, whose young women you were with, is he not our relative?

I will do for you all that you request, for all the people of my town know that you are a virtuous woman.","num":11},{"text":"Now it is true that I am a close relative; however, there is a relative closer than I.","num":12},{"text":"Stay this night, and in the morning it shall be that if he will perform the duty of a close relative for you--good; let him do it.

Lie down until morning.\"","num":13},{"text":"So she lay at his feet until morning, and she arose before one could recognize another. Then he said, \"Do not let it be known that the woman came to the threshing floor.\"","num":14},{"text":"Also he said, \"Bring the shawl that is on you and hold it.\" And when she held it, he measured six ephahs of barley, and laid it on her. Then she went into the city.","num":15},{"text":"When she came to her mother-in-law, she said, \"Is that you, my daughter?\" Then she told her all that the man had done for her.","num":16},{"text":"And she said, \"These six ephahs of barley he gave me; for he said to me, \"Do not go empty-handed to your mother-in-law.\"'","num":17},{"text":"Then she said, \"Sit still, my daughter, until you know how the matter will turn out; for the man will not rest until he has concluded the matter this day.\"","num":18}],"num":3},{"verses":[{"text":"Now Boaz went up to the gate and sat down there; and behold, the close relative of whom Boaz had spoken came by.

If you will redeem it, redeem it; but if you will not redeem it, then tell me, that I may know; for there is no one but you to redeem it, and I am next after you.\"' And he said, \"I will redeem it.\"","num":4},{"text":"Then Boaz said, \"On the day you buy the field from the hand of Naomi, you must also buy it from Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of the dead, to perpetuate the name of the dead through his inheritance.\"","num":5},{"text":"And the close relative said, \"I cannot redeem it for myself, lest I ruin my own inheritance. You redeem my right of redemption for yourself, for I cannot redeem it.\"","num":6},{"text":"Now this was the custom in former times in Israel concerning redeeming and exchanging, to confirm anything: one man took off his sandal and gave it to the other, and this was a confirmation in Israel.","num":7},{"text":"Therefore the close relative said to Boaz, \"Buy it for yourself.\" So he took off his sandal.","num":8},{"text":"And Boaz said to the elders and all the people, \"You are witnesses this day that I have bought all that was Elimelech's, and all that was Chilion's and Mahlon's, from the hand of Naomi.","num":9},{"text":"Moreover, Ruth the Moabitess, the widow of Mahlon, I have acquired as my wife, to perpetuate the name of the dead through his inheritance, that the name of the dead may not be cut off from among his brethren and from his position at the gate.
