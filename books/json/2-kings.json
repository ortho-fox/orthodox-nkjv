Tell me, what do you have in the house?\" And she said, \"Your maidservant has nothing in the house but a jar of oil.\"","num":2},{"text":"Then he said, \"Go, borrow vessels from everywhere, from all your neighbors--empty vessels; do not gather just a few.","num":3},{"text":"And when you have come in, you shall shut the door behind you and your sons; then pour it into all those vessels, and set aside the full ones.\"","num":4},{"text":"So she went from him and shut the door behind her and her sons, who brought the vessels to her; and she poured it out.","num":5},{"text":"Now it came to pass, when the vessels were full, that she said to her son, \"Bring me another vessel.\" And he said to her, \"There is not another vessel.\" So the oil ceased.","num":6},{"text":"Then she came and told the man of God.

Now it happened one day that he went out to his father, to the reapers.","num":18},{"text":"And he said to his father, \"My head, my head!\" So he said to a servant, \"Carry him to his mother.\"","num":19},{"text":"When he had taken him and brought him to his mother, he sat on her knees till noon, and then died.","num":20},{"text":"And she went up and laid him on the bed of the man of God, shut the door upon him, and went out.","num":21},{"text":"Then she called to her husband, and said, \"Please send me one of the young men and one of the donkeys, that I may run to the man of God and come back.\"","num":22},{"text":"So he said, \"Why are you going to him today?

So it was, when the man of God saw her afar off, that he said to his servant Gehazi, \"Look, the Shunammite woman!","num":25},{"text":"Please run now to meet her, and say to her, \"Is it well with you? Is it well with your husband? Is it well with the child?\"' And she answered, \"It is well.\"","num":26},{"text":"Now when she came to the man of God at the hill, she caught him by the feet, but Gehazi came near to push her away. But the man of God said, \"Let her alone; for her soul is in deep distress, and the LORD has hidden it from me, and has not told me.\"","num":27},{"text":"So she said, \"Did I ask a son of my lord? Did I not say, \"Do not deceive me'?\"","num":28},{"text":"Then he said to Gehazi, \"Get yourself ready, and take my staff in your hand, and be on your way. If you meet anyone, do not greet him; and if anyone greets you, do not answer him; but lay my staff on the face of the child.\"","num":29},{"text":"And the mother of the child said, \"As the LORD lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you.\" So he arose and followed her.","num":30},{"text":"Now Gehazi went on ahead of them, and laid the staff on the face of the child; but there was neither voice nor hearing. Therefore he went back to meet him, and told him, saying, \"The child has not awakened.\"","num":31},{"text":"When Elisha came into the house, there was the child, lying dead on his bed.","num":32},{"text":"He went in therefore, shut the door behind the two of them, and prayed to the LORD.","num":33},{"text":"And he went up and lay on the child, and put his mouth on his mouth, his eyes on his eyes, and his hands on his hands; and he stretched himself out on the child, and the flesh of the child became warm.","num":34},{"text":"He returned and walked back and forth in the house, and again went up and stretched himself out on him; then the child sneezed seven times, and the child opened his eyes.","num":35},{"text":"And he called Gehazi and said, \"Call this Shunammite woman.\" So he called her. And when she came in to him, he said, \"Pick up your son.\"","num":36},{"text":"So she went in, fell at his feet, and bowed to the ground; then she picked up her son and went out.","num":37},{"text":"And Elisha returned to Gilgal, and there was a famine in the land. Now the sons of the prophets were sitting before him; and he said to his servant, \"Put on the large pot, and boil stew for the sons of the prophets.\"","num":38},{"text":"So one went out into the field to gather herbs, and found a wild vine, and gathered from it a lapful of wild gourds, and came and sliced them into the pot of stew, though they did not know what they were.","num":39},{"text":"Then they served it to the men to eat. Now it happened, as they were eating the stew, that they cried out and said, \"Man of God, there is death in the pot!\" And they could not eat it.","num":40},{"text":"So he said, \"Then bring some flour.\" And he put it into the pot, and said, \"Serve it to the people, that they may eat.\" And there was nothing harmful in the pot.","num":41},{"text":"Then a man came from Baal Shalisha, and brought the man of God bread of the firstfruits, twenty loaves of barley bread, and newly ripened grain in his knapsack. And he said, \"Give it to the people, that they may eat.\"","num":42},{"text":"But his servant said, \"What? Shall I set this before one hundred men?\" He said again, \"Give it to the people, that they may eat; for thus says the LORD: \"They shall eat and have some left over.\"'","num":43},{"text":"So he set it before them; and they ate and had some left over, according to the word of the LORD.","num":44}],"num":4},{"verses":[{"text":"Now Naaman, commander of the army of the king of Syria, was a great and honorable man in the eyes of his master, because by him the LORD had given victory to Syria.

Therefore please consider, and see how he seeks a quarrel with me.\"","num":7},{"text":"So it was, when Elisha the man of God heard that the king of Israel had torn his clothes, that he sent to the king, saying, \"Why have you torn your clothes? Please let him come to me, and he shall know that there is a prophet in Israel.\"","num":8},{"text":"Then Naaman went with his horses and chariot, and he stood at the door of Elisha's house.","num":9},{"text":"And Elisha sent a messenger to him, saying, \"Go and wash in the Jordan seven times, and your flesh shall be restored to you, and you shall be clean.\"","num":10},{"text":"But Naaman became furious, and went away and said, \"Indeed, I said to myself, \"He will surely come out to me, and stand and call on the name of the LORD his God, and wave his hand over the place, and heal the leprosy.'","num":11},{"text":"Are not the Abanah and the Pharpar, the rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel?

How much more then, when he says to you, \"Wash, and be clean'?\"","num":13},{"text":"So he went down and dipped seven times in the Jordan, according to the saying of the man of God; and his flesh was restored like the flesh of a little child, and he was clean.","num":14},{"text":"And he returned to the man of God, he and all his aides, and came and stood before him; and he said, \"Indeed, now I know that there is no God in all the earth, except in Israel; now therefore, please take a gift from your servant.\"","num":15},{"text":"But he said, \"As the LORD lives, before whom I stand, I will receive nothing.\" And he urged him to take it, but he refused.","num":16},{"text":"So Naaman said, \"Then, if not, please let your servant be given two mule-loads of earth; for your servant will no longer offer either burnt offering or sacrifice to other gods, but to the LORD.","num":17},{"text":"Yet in this thing may the LORD pardon your servant: when my master goes into the temple of Rimmon to worship there, and he leans on my hand, and I bow down in the temple of Rimmon--when I bow down in the temple of Rimmon, may the LORD please pardon your servant in this thing.\"","num":18},{"text":"Then he said to him, \"Go in peace.\" So he departed from him a short distance.","num":19},{"text":"But Gehazi, the servant of Elisha the man of God, said, \"Look, my master has spared Naaman this Syrian, while not receiving from his hands what he brought; but as the LORD lives, I will run after him and take something from him.\"","num":20},{"text":"So Gehazi pursued Naaman. When Naaman saw him running after him, he got down from the chariot to meet him, and said, \"Is all well?\"","num":21},{"text":"And he said, \"All is well.

Is it time to receive money and to receive clothing, olive groves and vineyards, sheep and oxen, male and female servants?","num":26},{"text":"Therefore the leprosy of Naaman shall cling to you and your descendants forever.\" And he went out from his presence leprous, as white as snow.","num":27}],"num":5},{"verses":[{"text":"And the sons of the prophets said to Elisha, \"See now, the place where we dwell with you is too small for us.","num":1},{"text":"Please, let us go to the Jordan, and let every man take a beam from there, and let us make there a place where we may dwell.\" So he answered, \"Go.\"","num":2},{"text":"Then one said, \"Please consent to go with your servants.\" And he answered, \"I will go.\"","num":3},{"text":"So he went with them. And when they came to the Jordan, they cut down trees.","num":4},{"text":"But as one was cutting down a tree, the iron ax head fell into the water; and he cried out and said, \"Alas, master!

So he cut off a stick, and threw it in there; and he made the iron float.","num":6},{"text":"Therefore he said, \"Pick it up for yourself.\" So he reached out his hand and took it.","num":7},{"text":"Now the king of Syria was making war against Israel; and he consulted with his servants, saying, \"My camp will be in such and such a place.\"","num":8},{"text":"And the man of God sent to the king of Israel, saying, \"Beware that you do not pass this place, for the Syrians are coming down there.\"","num":9},{"text":"Then the king of Israel sent someone to the place of which the man of God had told him. Thus he warned him, and he was watchful there, not just once or twice.","num":10},{"text":"Therefore the heart of the king of Syria was greatly troubled by this thing; and he called his servants and said to them, \"Will you not show me which of us is for the king of Israel?\"","num":11},{"text":"And one of his servants said, \"None, my lord, O king; but Elisha, the prophet who is in Israel, tells the king of Israel the words that you speak in your bedroom.\"","num":12},{"text":"So he said, \"Go and see where he is, that I may send and get him.\" And it was told him, saying, \"Surely he is in Dothan.\"","num":13},{"text":"Therefore he sent horses and chariots and a great army there, and they came by night and surrounded the city.","num":14},{"text":"And when the servant of the man of God arose early and went out, there was an army, surrounding the city with horses and chariots. And his servant said to him, \"Alas, my master! What shall we do?\"","num":15},{"text":"So he answered, \"Do not fear, for those who are with us are more than those who are with them.\"","num":16},{"text":"And Elisha prayed, and said, \"LORD, I pray, open his eyes that he may see.\" Then the LORD opened the eyes of the young man, and he saw.

Follow me, and I will bring you to the man whom you seek.\" But he led them to Samaria.","num":19},{"text":"So it was, when they had come to Samaria, that Elisha said, \"LORD, open the eyes of these men, that they may see.\" And the LORD opened their eyes, and they saw; and there they were, inside Samaria!","num":20},{"text":"Now when the king of Israel saw them, he said to Elisha, \"My father, shall I kill them?
