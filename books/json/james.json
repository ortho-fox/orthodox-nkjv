So the rich man also will fade away in his pursuits.","num":11},{"text":"Blessed is the man who endures temptation; for when he has been approved, he will receive the crown of life which the Lord has promised to those who love Him.","num":12},{"text":"Let no one say when he is tempted, \"I am tempted by God\"; for God cannot be tempted by evil, nor does He Himself tempt anyone.","num":13},{"text":"But each one is tempted when he is drawn away by his own desires and enticed.","num":14},{"text":"Then, when desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin; and sin, when it is full-grown, brings forth death.","num":15},{"text":"Do not be deceived, my beloved brethren.","num":16},{"text":"Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and comes down from the Father of lights, with whom there is no variation or shadow of turning.","num":17},{"text":"Of His own will He brought us forth by the word of truth, that we might be a kind of firstfruits of His creatures.","num":18},{"text":"So then, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath;","num":19},{"text":"for the wrath of man does not produce the righteousness of God.","num":20},{"text":"Therefore lay aside all filthiness and overflow of wickedness, and receive with meekness the implanted word, which is able to save your souls.","num":21},{"text":"But be doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves.","num":22},{"text":"For if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man observing his natural face in a mirror;","num":23},{"text":"for he observes himself, goes away, and immediately forgets what kind of man he was.","num":24},{"text":"But he who looks into the perfect law of liberty and continues in it, and is not a forgetful hearer but a doer of the work, this one will be blessed in what he does.","num":25},{"text":"If anyone among you thinks he is religious, and does not bridle his tongue but deceives his own heart, this one's religion is useless.","num":26},{"text":"Pure and undefiled religion before God and the Father is this: to visit orphans and widows in their trouble, and to keep oneself unspotted from the world.","num":27}],"num":1},{"verses":[{"text":"My brethren, do not hold the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory, with partiality.","num":1},{"text":"For if there should come into your assembly a man with gold rings, in fine apparel, and there should also come in a poor man in filthy clothes,","num":2},{"text":"and you pay attention to the one wearing the fine clothes and say to him, \"You sit here in a good place,\" and say to the poor man, \"You stand there,\" or, \"Sit here at my footstool,\"","num":3},{"text":"have you not shown partiality among yourselves, and become judges with evil thoughts?","num":4},{"text":"Listen, my beloved brethren: Has God not chosen the poor of this world to be rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom which He promised to those who love Him?","num":5},{"text":"But you have dishonored the poor man.

Mercy triumphs over judgment.","num":13},{"text":"What does it profit, my brethren, if someone says he has faith but does not have works?

You do well. Even the demons believe--and tremble!","num":19},{"text":"But do you want to know, O foolish man, that faith without works is dead?","num":20},{"text":"Was not Abraham our father justified by works when he offered Isaac his son on the altar?","num":21},{"text":"Do you see that faith was working together with his works, and by works faith was made perfect?","num":22},{"text":"And the Scripture was fulfilled which says, \"Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness.\" And he was called the friend of God.","num":23},{"text":"You see then that a man is justified by works, and not by faith only.","num":24},{"text":"Likewise, was not Rahab the harlot also justified by works when she received the messengers and sent them out another way?","num":25},{"text":"For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also.","num":26}],"num":2},{"verses":[{"text":"My brethren, let not many of you become teachers, knowing that we shall receive a stricter judgment.","num":1},{"text":"For we all stumble in many things.

The tongue is so set among our members that it defiles the whole body, and sets on fire the course of nature; and it is set on fire by hell.","num":6},{"text":"For every kind of beast and bird, of reptile and creature of the sea, is tamed and has been tamed by mankind.","num":7},{"text":"But no man can tame the tongue.

My brethren, these things ought not to be so.","num":10},{"text":"Does a spring send forth fresh water and bitter from the same opening?","num":11},{"text":"Can a fig tree, my brethren, bear olives, or a grapevine bear figs? Thus no spring yields both salt water and fresh.","num":12},{"text":"Who is wise and understanding among you?
