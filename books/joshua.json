So they did six days.","num":14},{"text":"But it came to pass on the seventh day that they rose early, about the dawning of the day, and marched around the city seven times in the same manner. On that day only they marched around the city seven times.","num":15},{"text":"And the seventh time it happened, when the priests blew the trumpets, that Joshua said to the people: \"Shout, for the LORD has given you the city!","num":16},{"text":"Now the city shall be doomed by the LORD to destruction, it and all who are in it. Only Rahab the harlot shall live, she and all who are with her in the house, because she hid the messengers that we sent.","num":17},{"text":"And you, by all means abstain from the accursed things, lest you become accursed when you take of the accursed things, and make the camp of Israel a curse, and trouble it.","num":18},{"text":"But all the silver and gold, and vessels of bronze and iron, are consecrated to the LORD; they shall come into the treasury of the LORD.\"","num":19},{"text":"So the people shouted when the priests blew the trumpets. And it happened when the people heard the sound of the trumpet, and the people shouted with a great shout, that the wall fell down flat. Then the people went up into the city, every man straight before him, and they took the city.","num":20},{"text":"And they utterly destroyed all that was in the city, both man and woman, young and old, ox and sheep and donkey, with the edge of the sword.","num":21},{"text":"But Joshua had said to the two men who had spied out the country, \"Go into the harlot's house, and from there bring out the woman and all that she has, as you swore to her.\"","num":22},{"text":"And the young men who had been spies went in and brought out Rahab, her father, her mother, her brothers, and all that she had.
